### Electric Load Characteristics of 5G Base Station

The electric load characteristics of a 5G base station (BS) focus on the power consumption of the wireless equipment, particularly the Active Antenna Unit (AAU) and Baseband Unit (BBU). The following points outline the components and behavior of the electric load:

1. **Components of Electric Load**:
   - **Main Wireless Equipment Load**: This is the primary focus of the study.
   - **Air Conditioning Equipment Load**: Considered constant throughout the study.
   - **Lighting Equipment Load**: Ignored as it is only activated during maintenance.
   - **Power Equipment Load**: Accounts for approximately 8% of the main wireless equipment load and is considered constant.

2. **Power Consumption Model**:
   - **AAU + BBU Structure**: This is the dominant structure in urban areas and the primary focus of the study.
   - **RRU + BBU Structure**: Used in suburban areas with lower communication demand, similar to 4G BS.

3. **Power Consumption Components**:
   - **Baseline Power Consumption**: Constant power consumption for transmitting fixed signals when no users are connected. This includes the cell reference signal and the primary synchronization signal.
   - **Incremental Power Consumption**: Variable power consumption for uplink and downlink data services when multiple users connect to the BS.

4. **Power Consumption Behavior**:
   - **AAU**: The power consumption of the AAU increases significantly with the increasing number of terminal connections, as illustrated in various figures.
   - **BBU**: The BBU shows only a slight increase in power consumption, approximately 5% of the total BBU power consumption, making it reasonable to consider BBU's power consumption as a fixed value in this study.

5. **Mathematical Representation**:
   - The total power consumption of
