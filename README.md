### Electric Load Characteristics of 5G Base Stations

The electric load characteristics of a 5G base station (BS) focus on the power consumption of the wireless equipment, particularly the Active Antenna Unit (AAU) and Baseband Unit (BBU). The following points outline the components and behavior of the electric load:

1. **Components of Electric Load**:
   - **Main Wireless Equipment Load**: This is the primary focus of the study.
   - **Air Conditioning Equipment Load**: Considered constant throughout the study.
   - **Lighting Equipment Load**: Ignored as it is only activated during maintenance.
   - **Power Equipment Load**: Accounts for approximately 8% of the main wireless equipment load and is considered constant.

2. **Power Consumption Model**:
   - **AAU + BBU Structure**: This is the dominant structure in urban areas and the primary focus of the study.
   - **RRU + BBU Structure**: Used in suburban areas with lower communication demand, similar to 4G BS.

3. **Power Consumption Components**:
   - **Baseline Power Consumption**: Constant power consumption for transmitting fixed signals when no users are connected. This includes the cell reference signal and the primary synchronization signal.
   - **Incremental Power Consumption**: Variable power consumption for uplink and downlink data services when multiple users connect to the BS.

4. **Power Consumption Behavior**:
   - **AAU**: The power consumption of the AAU increases significantly with the increasing number of terminal connections, as illustrated in various figures.
   - **BBU**: The BBU shows only a slight increase in power consumption, approximately 5% of the total BBU power consumption, making it reasonable to consider BBU's power consumption as a fixed value in this study.

5. **Mathematical Representation**:
   - The total power consumption of the wireless equipment in a 5G BS at any time $t$ consists of both static baseline power consumption and time-varying incremental power consumption, represented by the equation:

*Equation 1:*

$$P_{we}(t) = P_{i,AAU}(t) + P_{b,AAU} + P_{b,BBU}$$

   where:
   - $P_{we}(t)$ is the total power consumption at time $t$.
   - $P_{i,AAU}(t)$ is the incremental power consumption of AAU at time $t$.
   - $P_{b,AAU}$ and $P_{b,BBU}$ are the baseline power consumptions of AAU and BBU, respectively.

### Incremental Power Consumption of AAU

The incremental power consumption of the AAU, denoted as $P_{i,\text{AAU}}(t)$, includes the power consumption due to downlink data transmission and downlink signaling when multiple users are connected to the base station. This power consumption is influenced by the type of mobile services activated by the connected users, such as video streaming, instant messaging, and web browsing.

#### Total Incremental Power Consumption:

*Equation 2:*
$$P_{i,\text{AAU}}(t) = P_{\text{idd},\text{AAU}}(t) + P_{\text{ids},\text{AAU}}(t)$$


- **$P_{\text{idd},\text{AAU}}(t)$**: Power consumption related to the downlink data volume at time $t$.
- **$P_{\text{ids},\text{AAU}}(t)$**: Power consumption related to downlink signaling REs (Resource Elements).

#### Power Consumption Related to Downlink Data Volume:

*Equation 3:*
$$P_{\text{idd},\text{AAU}}(t) = \frac{P_{\text{max},\text{AAU}} - P_{\text{b},\text{AAU}}}{T_{\text{dd},\text{max}}} \cdot T_{\text{dd}}(t)$$

- **$P_{\text{max},\text{AAU}}$**: Maximum power consumption of the AAU.
- **$P_{\text{b},\text{AAU}}$**: Baseline power consumption of the AAU.
- **$T_{\text{dd},\text{max}}$**: Maximum downlink data rate of the BS.
- **$T_{\text{dd}}(t)$**: Downlink data rate at time $t$.

#### Power Consumption Related to Downlink Signaling REs:

*Equation 4:*
$$P_{\text{ids},\text{AAU}}(t) = \frac{P_{\text{max},\text{AAU}} - P_{\text{b},\text{AAU}}}{R_{\text{ds},\text{RE}} + R_{\text{dd},\text{RE}}} \cdot R_{\text{ds}}(t)$$

- **$R_{\text{ds},\text{RE}}$**: Total available signaling REs for variable signaling per second.
- **$R_{\text{dd},\text{RE}}$**: Total available REs for downlink data per second.
- **$R_{\text{ds}}(t)$**: Downlink signaling REs at time $t$.

#### Relationship Between Data Rate and Signaling REs:

*Equation 5:*
$$T_{\text{dd}}(t) = A_{\text{RE}} \cdot R_{\text{ds}}(t)$$

- **$A_{\text{RE}}$**: Average amount of downlink data carried by each downlink signaling RE [Mb/RE], which depends on the average channel quality of the mobile devices.

### Hourly Data Usage Model

The hourly data usage for 5G network terminals in different usage states (normal and heavy) is modeled using exponential distributions. The following are key aspects of this model:

1. **Exponential Distribution for Data Usage**:
   - Hourly data usage for the normal use state $\alpha^n_k(t)$ and heavy use state $\alpha^h_k(t)$ follows an exponential distribution.
   - The probability density functions for these states are given by:

*Equation 6:*

$$f[\alpha^n_k(t)] = \frac{1}{\theta_{\alpha^n_k(t)}} e^{-\frac{\alpha^n_k(t)}{\theta_{\alpha^n_k(t)}}}, \quad \alpha^n_k(t) > 0$$

$$f[\alpha^h_k(t)] = \frac{1}{\theta_{\alpha^h_k(t)}} e^{-\frac{\alpha^h_k(t)}{\theta_{\alpha^h_k(t)}}}, \quad \alpha^h_k(t) > 0$$


2. **Parameters of Exponential Distribution**:
   - The parameters $\theta_{\alpha^n_k(t)}$ and $\theta_{\alpha^h_k(t)}$ represent the expected value of hourly data usage in different states.
   - These parameters are influenced by the bandwidth requirements of different services and the quality levels, such as non-video services and high-definition video streaming.

3. **Parameter Conversion**:
   - The parameters of the exponential distribution are converted using the mean value of historical data usage:

*Equation 7:*

$$\theta_{\alpha^n_k(t)} = \gamma_Q M_{\alpha^n_k}$$

$$\theta_{\alpha^h_k(t)} = \gamma_Q M_{\alpha^h_k}$$
     
   - Here, $\gamma_Q$ depends on the average bandwidth requirement for different quality levels of 5G applications compared to historical data usage.

### Electric Load Demand Model of Multiple Terminals

This model estimates the electric load demand for multiple terminals connected to a 5G base station using a probability theory approach, particularly the Poisson distribution.

#### Data Usage of Multiple Terminals

- **Individual Terminal Behavior**:
  - The data usage for each terminal in a given area $k$ at time $t$ can be determined from the probability density function (PDF) based on the usage state and bandwidth requirement of the user.

- **Accumulated Data Usage**:
  - The total data usage for all activated terminals in area $k$ at time $t$ is the sum of the data usage of each terminal. This total usage is directly related to the overall power consumption of the 5G BS serving the area.

#### Number of Activated Terminals

- **Modeling the Number of Activated Terminals**:
  - The number of activated terminals $\beta_k(t)$ in different types of areas is modeled using a Poisson distribution:

*Equation 8:*
$$P[\beta_k(t) = n] = \frac{\lambda_{\beta_k(t)}^n e^{-\lambda_{\beta_k(t)}}}{n!}, \quad n = 1, 2, \dots$$

  - The parameter $\lambda_{\beta_k(t)}$ represents the expected number of activated terminals at time $t$ in area $k$.

---

### Monte Carlo Sampling Process

The Monte Carlo sampling approach models and estimates the hourly total data usage and corresponding electric load of 5G BSs.

1. **Generate Hourly Activated Terminals**:
   - **Poisson Distribution**: The number of activated terminals $\beta_k(t,s_a)$ at time $t$ in area $k$ is generated based on a Poisson distribution using Monte Carlo sampling.

2. **Generate Hourly Data Usage per Terminal**:
   - For each activated terminal, Monte Carlo sampling generates hourly data usage based on the exponential distribution. The total downlink data usage for the $s_a$-th sample in area $k$ at time $t$ can be calculated using:

*Equation 9:*
$$T_{\text{dd},k}(t,s_a) = \sum_{s_d=1}^{\beta_k(t,s_a)} T_{\text{dd},k}(t,s_a,s_d)$$

3. **Calculate Mean Total Data Usage**:
   - Repeating the above steps $N_m$ times for each hour, the mean total data usage $\mu_{\text{data},k}(t)$ in area $k$ at time $t$ is calculated as:

*Equation 10:*
$$\mu_{\text{data},k}(t) = \frac{1}{N_m} \sum_{s_a=1}^{N_m} T_{\text{dd},k}(t,s_a)$$

---

### Calculation of Downlink Data Rate and Signaling REs (Continued)

1. **Total Equivalent Downlink Data Rate**:
   - Once the mean total data usage for multiple terminals is obtained, the total equivalent downlink data rate $T_{\text{dd},k}(t)$ can be determined using the following equation:

*Equation 5:*
$$T_{\text{dd}}(t) = A_{\text{RE}} \cdot R_{\text{ds}}(t)$$
   

2. **Calculation of Downlink Data Rate and Signaling REs**:
   - The downlink data rate and signaling REs at time $t$ in area $k$ can be calculated using:


*Equation 11:*  

$$T_{\text{dd},k}(t) = \frac{8 \cdot \mu_{\text{data},k}(t)}{3600}$$

$$R_{\text{ds},k}(t) = \frac{T_{\text{dd},k}(t)}{A_{\text{RE}}}$$

### Implications for 5G BS Electric Load

The estimation of the total electric load of 5G BSs in the area provides insights into how the network’s energy consumption fluctuates based on user demand and service usage.

1. **Total Electric Load Estimation**:
   - The total hourly electric load of 5G BSs in the area can be estimated using the equations provided. These calculations help assess the impact of 5G BS electric load on the overall distribution system.

2. **Handling Maximum Load**:
   - If the total downlink data rate and signaling REs exceed the maximum available value of the 5G BS, the BS will operate at its maximum power. To manage the load within the BS's capacity, the resources allocated to each activated terminal will be proportionally reduced.

---

### Final Process: Calculating the Total Power Consumption of 5G BSs

The process for calculating the total power consumption of 5G BSs in a given area $k$ at time $t$ involves both incremental and baseline power consumption considerations for various components, such as the Active Antenna Unit (AAU) and Baseband Unit (BBU). The following key equations and steps outline this process:

1. **Total Downlink Data Rate and Signaling REs**:
   
*Equation 12:*  

$$T_{dd,k}(t) = \min \[ N_k \cdot T_{dd_{max}} , T_{dd,k}(t)]$$

$$R_{ds,k}(t) = \min \[ N_k \cdot R_{ds_{max}} , R_{ds,k}(t)]$$

$$R_{ds_{max}} = R_{ds_{RE}} + R_{dd_{RE}}$$




2. **Incremental Power Consumption of AAU**:
   - The incremental power consumption is calculated by substituting the total downlink data rate and signaling REs into the incremental power consumption equations:

*Equation 13:*  

$$P_{idd,AAU,k}(t) = N_k \cdot \frac{P_{max,AAU} - P_{b,AAU}}{T_{dd_{max}}} \cdot \frac{T_{dd,k}(t)}{N_k}$$

*Equation 14:*  

$$P_{ids,AAU,k}(t) = N_k \cdot \frac{P_{max,AAU} - P_{b,AAU}}{R_{ds_{RE}} + R_{dd_{RE}}} \cdot \frac{R_{ds,k}(t)}{N_k}$$


3. **Baseline Power Consumption**:
   - The baseline power consumption for the AAU and BBU in area $k$ at time $t$ is given by:

*Equations 15:*  

$$P_{b,AAU,k} = N_k \cdot P_{b,AAU}$$

*Equations 16:* 

$$P_{b,BBU,k} = N_k \cdot P_{b,BBU}$$

4. **Total Power Consumption**:
   - The total power consumption for a single AAU, including incremental and baseline components, is calculated as:

*Equation 17:*  

$$P_{i,AAU,k}(t) = P_{idd,AAU,k}(t) + P_{ids,AAU,k}(t)$$

   - The total power consumption for the 5G BS in area $k$ at time $t$ is then given by:

*Equation 18:*  

$$P_{we,k}(t) = P_{i,AAU,k}(t) + P_{b,AAU,k} + P_{b,BBU,k}$$

5. **Final Total Power Consumption Including Air Conditioning and Power Equipment**:
   - Including the power consumption of air conditioning and power equipment, the final total power consumption for all BSs in area $k$ is:

*Equation 19:*  

$$P_{s_{total},k}(t) = P_{we,k}(t) + N_k \cdot P_{ac,pe}(t)$$

$$P_{s\ _{total},k}(t) = P_{we,k}(t) + N_k \cdot P_{ac,pe}(t)$$   

This comprehensive model allows for the precise estimation of power consumption by 5G BSs, providing a critical tool for managing energy efficiency and optimizing network performance in the context of increasing demand for mobile services.
