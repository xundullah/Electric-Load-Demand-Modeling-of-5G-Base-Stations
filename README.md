# Electric Load Demand Modeling of 5G Base Stations

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive report on electric load demand modeling for 5G base stations (BSs), considering multiple terminals' activation and usage patterns. The modeling approach utilizes probability distributions, Monte Carlo simulations, and detailed nomenclature to predict BS power consumption behavior. Understanding these dynamics is critical for assessing the energy impact of 5G technology in urban environments.
